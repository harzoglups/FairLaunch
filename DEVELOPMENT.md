# FairLaunch - Development Notes

## Quick Start for New Session

### Build and Installation
```bash
# Build with Android Studio Java
export JAVA_HOME="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home"
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Install on device
~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

# Launch the app
~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb shell am start -n com.fairlaunch/.MainActivity
```

### Debugging
```bash
# View Worker logs
~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb logcat | grep LocationCheckWorker

# View boot and worker logs
~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb logcat | grep -E "(BootReceiver|LocationCheckWorker)"

# Clear and view logs
~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb logcat -c && ~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb logcat | grep LocationCheckWorker

# Check if device is connected
~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb devices

# Check GPS/location status
~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb shell settings get secure location_providers_allowed

# Check app permissions
~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb shell dumpsys package com.fairlaunch | grep -A 5 "granted=true"

# Check WorkManager diagnostics
~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb shell am broadcast -a "androidx.work.diagnostics.REQUEST_DIAGNOSTICS" -p com.fairlaunch
```

## Important Technical Decisions

### 1. Fairtiq Package Name
- **Package used**: `com.fairtiq.android` (verified and working)
- **Location**: `LocationCheckWorker.kt` line 34
- Tested with: `adb shell monkey -p com.fairtiq.android -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER 1`

### 2. Check Intervals
- **Format**: Seconds (to ease testing)
- **Default**: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- **WorkManager limitation**: Minimum 15 minutes for PeriodicWork
- **Solution**: For intervals < 900s, uses OneTimeWorkRequest with auto-rescheduling
- **Location**: `LocationWorkScheduler.kt` and `LocationCheckWorker.rescheduleIfNeeded()`

### 3. Hilt + WorkManager
- **Required configuration**:
  - `FairLaunchApplication` implements `Configuration.Provider`
  - `HiltWorkerFactory` injection
  - Disable WorkManager auto-init in `AndroidManifest.xml`
- **Location**: `FairLaunchApplication.kt`, `AndroidManifest.xml` (meta-data with `tools:node="remove"`)

### 4. Distance Calculation
- **Method**: Haversine formula (pure Kotlin)
- **Reason**: Avoid Android dependency in domain layer
- **Location**: `CheckProximityUseCase.calculateDistance()`

### 5. Anti-Spam Proximity
- **Mechanism**: Store state (inside/outside) per point in Room
- **Trigger**: Only on outside → inside transition
- **Database**: Table `proximity_states` with `point_id` and `is_inside`

### 6. Map and Location
- **Auto-centering**: `locationOverlay.runOnFirstFix` + `controller.animateTo()`
- **Follow mode**: `enableFollowLocation()` enabled
- **Initial zoom**: 15 (closer)
- **Proximity circles**: Red semi-transparent circles displayed on map for each point

### 7. Boot Auto-Start
- **BootReceiver**: Triggers on `ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED`
- **Delay**: 30 seconds initial delay to allow GPS initialization (cold start)
- **GPS timeout**: 30 seconds for first location request after boot
- **Verification**: Checks DataStore file existence to avoid premature initialization
- **Location**: `BootReceiver.kt` with 30s `setInitialDelay()`

### 8. Notifications and Alerts
- **Full-screen intent**: Launches Fairtiq and wakes screen even when locked
- **Direct vibration**: Strong 3-burst pattern (500ms each) at max amplitude
- **Permission flow**: Requests POST_NOTIFICATIONS on first launch (Android 13+)
- **Channel**: "Alertes de proximité" with HIGH importance
- **Location**: `LocationCheckWorker.launchFairtiqAndVibrate()` and `MainActivity.requestNotificationPermissionIfNeeded()`

## Data Structure

### DataStore (Settings)
```kotlin
check_interval_seconds: Int = 300    // Changed from minutes to seconds
proximity_distance_meters: Int = 200
location_tracking_enabled: Boolean = false
```

### Room Database
**Table: map_points**
- id (PK, auto-increment)
- latitude (Double)
- longitude (Double)
- created_at (Long)

**Table: proximity_states**
- point_id (PK, FK → map_points)
- is_inside (Boolean)

## Points of Attention

### For Production
1. **Permissions**: Implement 2-step flow for BACKGROUND_LOCATION (Android 10+)
2. **Interval**: Option to revert to minutes (or keep seconds with min/max validation)
3. **Battery optimization**: Test on different devices with Doze mode
4. **Icons**: Add custom launcher icons
5. **Notification permission**: Already implemented - requests on first launch (Android 13+)

### Known Limitations
1. WorkManager PeriodicWork minimum = 15 minutes
2. No notification during checks (by design)
3. GPS accuracy depends on device power-saving settings
4. Android Doze mode may pause background checks when device is idle (normal battery optimization)

### Doze Mode Considerations

**Current Implementation:** WorkManager (battery-friendly)

**Doze Impact with 2-minute intervals:**
- ✅ **In motion** (typical transport use): Doze doesn't activate, works perfectly
- ⚠️ **Stationary 30+ minutes** with screen off: Checks may be delayed/batched
- 🔋 **Battery friendly**: Respects Android power management

**If Doze becomes problematic in real-world usage:**

**Option 1: Foreground Service** (not recommended)
- Pros: Never interrupted, guaranteed precision
- Cons: Mandatory permanent notification, higher battery drain
- Use case: Only if critical precision needed

**Option 2: REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS** (recommended if needed)
- Pros: Exempts app from Doze, no permanent notification
- Cons: User must manually approve, Google Play may scrutinize
- Implementation:
  ```kotlin
  // In AndroidManifest.xml
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS" />
  
  // Request exemption
  val intent = Intent(Settings.ACTION_REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS)
  intent.data = Uri.parse("package:$packageName")
  startActivity(intent)
  ```
- Add in Settings UI: "Disable battery optimization" option with explanation

**Decision:** Stay with current WorkManager implementation. Only implement Option 2 if real-world testing reveals issues.
