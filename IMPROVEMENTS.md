# AutoTiq - Improvement Suggestions

This document lists potential improvements and new features to consider before moving to closed beta testing.

## 🎯 Top 5 Priorities for Closed Beta

1. **Test Mode** - Allow beta testers to simulate zone entry without physically moving
2. **Activation History** - Log when Fairtiq was automatically launched (helps with bug reports)
3. **Empty State Message** - Show helpful message when no points exist ("Long press on map to add your first point")
4. **Fairtiq Installation Check** - Verify Fairtiq is installed and show warning if not
5. **Global Pause Mode** - Quick toggle to temporarily disable all points
